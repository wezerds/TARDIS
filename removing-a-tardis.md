# Removing the TARDIS

To delete your TARDIS, you break the sign above the door of the TARDIS Police Box.

**Note:** As of version `2.7` the TARDIS Chameleon Circuit is no longer required to be set to a Police Box preset. Any sign on your TARDIS can be broken to delete it.

You will be asked to confirm the TARDIS deletion with a command. Type:

    /tardis exterminate

To confirm the deletion.

**WARNING:** You will lose any items you have stored in your TARDIS; all rooms, and any saved time travel destinations (unless stored within the [TARDIS Disk Storage Container](advanced-console.html#storage_info)) will be removed.
