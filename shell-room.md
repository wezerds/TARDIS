# The Shell Room

In the Whoniverse, the shell room is an area in the TARDIS where plasmic shells are stored. The chameleon circuit picks the most suitable shell from the room and applies it as the ship’s exterior.

You can use the shell room to construct your own custom chameleon design (make sure you grow the room first).

Place blocks from your inventory onto the platform. The door should be on the side with the stone slab sticking out.

You construct the chameleon shell in the same way as the server’s [custom preset](custom-preset.html).

- The minimum requirement is one block and a door.
- The maximum size is 3 block wide x 3 blocks deep x 4 blocks high.
- You can add a sign on the side with the stone slab sticking out. Text on the sign will be saved with the construct. You can use `&PLAYER` as a placeholder for the player’s name.

To save the chameleon construct, click the stone button on the platform.
